          <p>hello! welcome to jing's site. she was born on october 21, 2002 in guangzhou, china before moving to the united states at a young age. her family did not speak any english so it was hard. she is an only-child but always wondered how it would be like if she had a sibling.</p>

          <p>jing was planning to go the pre-med route and become a doctor. however, she started to think about what makes her happy. from a young age, she always had interest in art and design but was told she would not make much money so she turned away from it.</p>

          <p>during the weekends, jing spends time with her parents such as going out to eat dimsum. she also naps a lot. especially when she gets home from her classes in the morning because she does not sleep very well. she also goes to the library often.</p>
