      <p>hi! welcome to jing's site. she is a first year visual design communication major at san francisco state university. she was born on october 21, 2002 in guangzhou, china before moving to the united states at a young age. she is an only-child but always wondered how it would be like if she had a sibling.</p>


      <p>originally, i was planning to go the pre-med route and become a doctor. however, i did not like science as much as i thought. i started to think about what makes me happy. from a young age, i always had interest in art and design but i was told i would not make much money so i turned away from it. but now, i am back to my roots, happier than ever. </p>
