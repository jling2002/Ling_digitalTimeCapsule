      <h1>about jing</h1>
    
      <p>hi! welcome to jing's site. she is a first year visual design communication major at san francisco state university. she was born on october 21, 2002 in guangzhou, china before moving to the united states at a young age. she is an only-child but always wondered how it would be like if she had a sibling.</p>


      <p>originally, jing was planning to go the pre-med route and become a doctor. however, she did not like science as much as she thought. she started to think about what makes her happy. from a young age, she always had interest in art and design but was told she would not make much money so she turned away from it. but now, she is back to my roots, happier than ever. </p>


      <p>during the weekends, jing spends time with her parents such as going out to eat dimsum. she also naps a lot. especially when she gets home from her classes in the morning because she does not sleep very well. </p>
